# üîí Cybersecurity Attack Detection Lab

## üìã Project Overview
I built this cybersecurity lab to learn how hackers attack networks and how to defend against them. I used two virtual machines - one as an attacker (Kali Linux) and one as a target (Ubuntu). Then I created Python scripts to detect attacks in real-time and generate professional security reports.

## üéØ What I Wanted to Learn
- How network attacks work in real life
- How to detect suspicious activity on a network
- How to analyze network traffic
- How to write security tools in Python
- How to create professional security reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I Used
- **Kali Linux** - For attacking
- **Ubuntu Linux** - As the target system
- **Python** - For writing detection scripts
- **Wireshark** - For analyzing network packets
- **Nmap** - For network scanning
- **UFW Firewall** - For defense
- **VirtualBox** - For running virtual machines

## üì∏ Project Screenshots

### Step 1: Setting Up My Lab Environment
I started by creating two virtual machines on the same network so they could communicate with each other.

*Setting up VirtualBox with both VMs*

![Kali Network Config](screenshots/Capture2.PNG)
*Configuring Kali Linux network settings to NAT Network*

![Ubuntu Network Config](screenshots/Capture3.PNG)
*Configuring Ubuntu network settings - both VMs are now on the same network (10.0.2.x)*

### Step 2: Preparing the Target System
I set up Ubuntu as my target system and configured its defenses.

*Updating Ubuntu system packages to latest versions*

![Installing Tools](screenshots/Capture5.PNG)
*Installing essential tools and configuring network settings*

![Firewall Setup](screenshots/Capture6.PNG)
*Setting up UFW firewall - allowing SSH and connections from Kali (10.0.2.3)*

### Step 3: Preparing the Attack System
I configured Kali Linux with all the necessary hacking tools.

*Updating Kali Linux and installing tools*

*Kali Linux ready with Nmap and Metasploit framework*

### Step 4: Launching the Attack
I used Nmap to scan the Ubuntu machine and find open ports and services.

![Nmap Scan](screenshots/Capture9.PNG)
*Running Nmap scans to discover open ports on Ubuntu (10.0.2.15)*

### Step 5: Building Detection Tools
I wrote Python scripts to detect when someone is scanning my network.

![Python Scripts](screenshots/Capture10.PNG)
*My custom Python scripts for detection and reporting*

### Step 6: Attack Simulation
I created an automated attack script to simulate a real hacker.

![Attack Script Running](screenshots/Capture11.PNG)
*My attack script running - performing network reconnaissance*

![Attack Execution](screenshots/Capture14.PNG)
*Attack script completed - found open ports and services*

### Step 7: Real-Time Detection
My Python detection script monitors for suspicious activity.

![Detection Running](screenshots/Capture12.PNG)
*Detection script attempting to monitor connections (had a small bug here that I fixed later)*

### Step 8: Packet Analysis with Wireshark
I captured all network traffic during the attack to analyze what happened.

![Wireshark Capture](screenshots/Capture15.PNG)
*Wireshark showing all network packets during the attack*

![Filtered Analysis](screenshots/Capture16.PNG)
*Filtered view showing only packets from the attacker (10.0.2.3) - you can see the SYN scan pattern*

### Step 9: Generating Security Reports
I created a Python script that automatically generates professional HTML reports.

*Generating the security report from captured data*

![Final Report](screenshots/Capture18.PNG)
*Professional HTML security report showing the attack summary and recommendations*

## üíª Code Files

### 1. Detection Script (`detect_scan.py`)
This script monitors network connections and alerts when it detects a port scan:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
import time
from datetime import datetime

def monitor_connections():
    print("[*] Starting Port Scan Detection...")
    print("[*] Monitoring on Ubuntu 10.0.2.15")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    connection_count = {}
    
    while True:
        result = subprocess.run(['ss', '-tn'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        
        for line in result.stdout.split('\n'):
            if '10.0.2.3' in line:  # Detect connections from Kali
                if '10.0.2.3' not in connection_count:
                    connection_count['10.0.2.3'] = 0
                connection_count['10.0.2.3'] += 1
                
                if connection_count['10.0.2.3'] > 5:
                    print(f"[!] ALERT: Port scan detected from Kali (10.0.2.3)")
                    print(f"    Time: {datetime.now()}")
                    print(f"    Connections: {connection_count['10.0.2.3']}")
                    print("-" * 50)
        
        time.sleep(3)
        connection_count.clear()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_connections()
```

### 2. Report Generator (`generate_report.py`)
This script creates professional HTML reports:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import datetime
import os

def create_report():
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    html = f"""<!DOCTYPE html>
