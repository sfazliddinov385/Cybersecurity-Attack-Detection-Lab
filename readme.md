# üîí Cybersecurity Attack Detection Lab

## üìã Project Overview
I built this cybersecurity lab to learn how hackers attack networks and how to defend against them. I used two virtual machines - one as an attacker (Kali Linux) and one as a target (Ubuntu). Then I created Python scripts to detect attacks in real-time and generate professional security reports.

## üéØ What I Wanted to Learn
- How network attacks work in real life
- How to detect suspicious activity on a network
- How to analyze network traffic
- How to write security tools in Python
- How to create professional security reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I Used
- **Kali Linux** - For attacking
- **Ubuntu Linux** - As the target system
- **Python** - For writing detection scripts
- **Wireshark** - For analyzing network packets
- **Nmap** - For network scanning
- **UFW Firewall** - For defense
- **VirtualBox** - For running virtual machines

## üì∏ Project Screenshots

### Step 1: Setting Up My Lab Environment
I started by creating two virtual machines on the same network so they could communicate with each other.

*Setting up VirtualBox with both VMs*

![Kali Network Config](screenshots/Capture2.PNG)
*Configuring Kali Linux network settings to NAT Network*

![Ubuntu Network Config](screenshots/Capture3.PNG)
*Configuring Ubuntu network settings - both VMs are now on the same network (10.0.2.x)*

### Step 2: Preparing the Target System
I set up Ubuntu as my target system and configured its defenses.

![System Update](screenshots/Capture4.PNG)
*Updating Ubuntu system packages to latest versions*

![Installing Tools](screenshots/Capture5.PNG)
*Installing essential tools and configuring network settings*

![Firewall Setup](screenshots/Capture6.PNG)
*Setting up UFW firewall - allowing SSH and connections from Kali (10.0.2.3)*

### Step 3: Preparing the Attack System
I configured Kali Linux with all the necessary hacking tools.

*Updating Kali Linux and installing tools*

*Kali Linux ready with Nmap and Metasploit framework*

### Step 4: Launching the Attack
I used Nmap to scan the Ubuntu machine and find open ports and services.

![Nmap Scan](screenshots/Capture9.PNG)
*Running Nmap scans to discover open ports on Ubuntu (10.0.2.15)*

### Step 5: Building Detection Tools
I wrote Python scripts to detect when someone is scanning my network.

![Python Scripts](screenshots/Capture10.PNG)
*My custom Python scripts for detection and reporting*

### Step 6: Attack Simulation
I created an automated attack script to simulate a real hacker.

![Attack Script Running](screenshots/Capture11.PNG)
*My attack script running - performing network reconnaissance*

![Attack Execution](screenshots/Capture14.PNG)
*Attack script completed - found open ports and services*

### Step 7: Real-Time Detection
My Python detection script monitors for suspicious activity.

![Detection Running](screenshots/Capture12.PNG)
*Detection script attempting to monitor connections (had a small bug here that I fixed later)*

### Step 8: Packet Analysis with Wireshark
I captured all network traffic during the attack to analyze what happened.

![Wireshark Capture](screenshots/Capture15.PNG)
*Wireshark showing all network packets during the attack*

![Filtered Analysis](screenshots/Capture16.PNG)
*Filtered view showing only packets from the attacker (10.0.2.3) - you can see the SYN scan pattern*

### Step 9: Generating Security Reports
I created a Python script that automatically generates professional HTML reports.

![Report Generation](screenshots/Capture17.PNG)
*Generating the security report from captured data*

![Final Report](screenshots/Capture18.PNG)
*Professional HTML security report showing the attack summary and recommendations*

## üíª Code Files

### 1. Detection Script (`detect_scan.py`)
This script monitors network connections and alerts when it detects a port scan:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Monitors network for suspicious scanning activity
# Alerts when multiple connections detected from same IP
2. Report Generator (generate_report.py)
This script creates professional HTML reports:
python#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Generates HTML security assessment reports
# Includes findings, severity levels, and recommendations
3. Attack Script (attack_scan.sh)
Bash script to automate the attack process:
bash#!/bin/bash
# Performs network reconnaissance
# Runs multiple Nmap scan types
üöÄ How to Run This Project
Requirements

VirtualBox installed on your computer
Kali Linux VM (attacker)
Ubuntu VM (target)
Both VMs on the same NAT Network

Setup Instructions

Configure Network: Set both VMs to use NAT Network in VirtualBox
Install Tools on Ubuntu:

bashsudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw wireshark python3

Configure Firewall:

bashsudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.3

Run Detection Script (on Ubuntu):

bashsudo python3 detect_scan.py

Launch Attack (from Kali):

bash./attack_scan.sh

Generate Report (on Ubuntu):

bashpython3 generate_report.py
üìä Results and Findings
What I Discovered:

Open Ports Found: SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
Attack Type Detected: TCP SYN Scan
Total Packets Captured: 2000+
Detection Success Rate: Successfully detected port scanning activity

Security Recommendations I Made:

Block suspicious IPs temporarily
Enable rate limiting on firewall
Implement fail2ban for SSH protection
Review and update firewall rules regularly
Deploy IDS/IPS system for real-time monitoring

üéì What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:

How attackers gather information about target systems
The importance of network monitoring and logging
How to analyze packet-level data to identify attacks
How to write custom security tools in Python
The value of automated reporting for security incidents
